    <p id="item2" class="text">My first exposure to engineering was when I was 10 years old and disassembled an old iPod. Seeing electronic components behind 
      such an interactive device struck me with an interest in hardware and how simple 1s and 0s make up our digital world. Ever since then, I have consumed everything
      tutorial and lecture I could find on the internet regarding how computers work. Currently, I am a Junior at Vanderbilt University studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.
      I am interested not only in the hardware that modern devices operate on, but also the interactive software systems that we use every day.
